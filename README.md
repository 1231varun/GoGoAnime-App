# GoGoAnime-App
Webview app for gogoanime.io which disables ad popups and hides ads after page loads

This is a webview based app. It has most of the functionalities required to run any web based apps on the android device.

I've made this app so I can watch Anime ad free as the pop up ads are a pain and usually redirect us to harmful websites.

This app has been written with a simple logic to prevent unauthorized websites from loading within the webview thereby
disallowing popup ads and other webpages.

The webview supports full screen video playback and can save the state of the page as well.

Still under development trying to find bugs and update it on the go.

You can use this as a template for creating any webview based apps. It can also be used to make webview based games. Check my other repo 
which holds a puzzle game built purely out of Javascript and HTML.

Thanks and Have fun :)
